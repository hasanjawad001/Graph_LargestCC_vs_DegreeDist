# Graph Characteristics: Largest Connected Component vs Degree Distribution

This project explores the fraction of nodes in the largest connected component (LCC) of random graphs generated using the Erdős–Rényi model (G(n, p)). The main goal is to analyze how the fraction of nodes in the LCC changes with varying connection probabilities and graph sizes.

## Overview

- **Algorithm**: Generates undirected Erdős–Rényi graphs for different values of `n` (number of nodes) and `p` (probability of connection).
- **Plot**: Displays the relationship between `[p*(n-1)]` and the fraction of nodes in the LCC.
